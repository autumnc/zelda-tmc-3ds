 * TMC UI furniture for the second screen, decoded from ROM at runtime —

 * icons and digit fonts, and the pause menu's equip cursor and A/B button
 * bubbles. Zero baked pixels: everything is rebuilt from the same ROM
 * tables the game itself loads (gGfxGroups / gPaletteGroups / the text
 * border data), via the Port_* accessors at the end of src/common.c.
 *
 * Threading/caching contract: everything is built lazily, ONCE, on the
 * first Port_SecondScreenTheme_Ready() call that finds the ROM tables
 * resolved, into private RGBA buffers that are immutable afterwards. Only
 * the second-screen render thread calls into this module, so there is no
 * cross-thread publication to manage — but the build still reads nothing
 * live: ROM-const data only (same policy as port_second_screen_render.c).
 * Per-frame cost after the build is scaled blits of the cached buffers.
 *
 * No Android headers — plain C over caller-provided RGBA8888 buffers, so
 * the file compiles (as dead code) on every platform this port targets.
